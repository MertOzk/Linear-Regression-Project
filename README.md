In this project I investigated a mock ecommerce dataset to determine what factors contribute to increased yearly spending by customers. The  data set provides information on customer purchases from a the mock company. The mock company is said to offer in-store and online purchases and wishes to find out wheter customer time spent on the website or the app has more weight in yearly spending.

Columns of Interest:
* Avg. Session Length - Customer time spent in-store
* Time on App - Customer time spent viewing the app
* Time on Website - Customer time spent viewing the website
* Length of Membership - Length of Customer Membership
* Yearly Amount Spent - Yearly amount s pent by the customer

***The dataset is obtained from Pieran Data through their Udemy Course and all the information on the dataset (credit card #,emails etc are not real). I do not own any copyright on the dataset and am simply using for my project***
